# Employee Turnover Predict


## Introduction
After the data is preprocessed, the data is visualized to understand the overview of the data, and feature selection is performed through statistical method, correlation coefficient, and filtering method. The data of different characteristics are scored for different algorithms, including KNN, GaussianNB, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc. 
Finally, the highest-scoring features and algorithms are used to predict employee turnover, and visualize them, and finally produce a report. (reference link: [analysis report](https://github.com/simple1017/TurnoverPredict/blob/master/analysis%20report.pdf))
